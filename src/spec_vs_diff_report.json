  "summary": "Diff implements custom-domain validation that accepts dotted FQDNs, adds runtime logo fallbacks, and reinforces hash-based routing with a NotFound route plus a deployment guide. However, a true \"live deployment URL\" cannot be verified from code changes alone, and new user-facing Hindi text/new 404 page appear outside the request constraints/non-goals.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the website is fully accessible as a deployed live site on the Internet Computer (including providing/ensuring a live deployment URL and verifying all specified hash routes and admin auth flow post-deployment).",
      "reason": "The diff adds hash routing configuration and a deployment checklist, but does not provide or evidence an actual deployed/live URL or deployment configuration changes that guarantee the site is live on IC. From the diff summary alone, post-deployment behavior cannot be confirmed.",
