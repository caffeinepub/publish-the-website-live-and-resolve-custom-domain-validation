  "summary": "The BuildRequest contains no explicit implementation requirements beyond deployment intent and constraints/non-goals. The diff does not show any Internet Computer deployment/hosting changes; instead it introduces substantial new backend functionality and updates project tracking metadata, which appears outside scope and conflicts with the stated non-goals (no new site features/pages unrelated to deployment).",

      "description": "Added extensive new backend domain model and APIs (user profiles, organization details, about-us content, projects, gallery, access control, blob storage mixins/authorization).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest specifies no feature changes and explicitly lists non-goals like adding new site features unrelated to deployment; these backend additions constitute new functionality rather than deployment configuration.",
